- SOLVED: not detecting that player is already chopping wood

-cant do forestry fires

-after only tree in the area was chopped it clicked the red not woodcutting text based on the color red

- server.py needs to be checked, woodcutting.py references the server stream




-SOLVED window resizing might need to loop through mutltiple runelite windows
